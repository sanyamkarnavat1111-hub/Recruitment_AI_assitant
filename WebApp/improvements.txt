                    *** Features that can be added ***
    
    # Improve sql agent by making it yield list of SQL queries instead of one for more robust data retrieval
        (Currently there are only two tables and LLM is capable enough to retrieve the data in single query)

    # Enable streaming in the chat and response generation
        (streaming is enabled in ChatGroq but due to complexity in langgraph workflow invocation this becomes too risky)





                                *** Pending *** 
    
    # Create a clickable elements for followup questions in front end
    # Improve prompts in util code ( Sometimes no followups are asked , sometimes very short answers are povided for the queries.)
    # Add api rate limit to avoid spamming and abuse




                        *** Changes Done ***
    # Added a google sheet connector component 
    # Add a Dependency injection for thread id so that for every request we do not have to check if the thread id is provided or not.
    # Add a summarizer for job description as well .
    # The database entry like total year of experience should keep on getting updated (like if at the time of upload the candidate had 3 years of experience then after one years it should automatically update ) 
    # Add a regex checker for email , url and phone number.
    # Added case insensitive 'ilike' searches for names and other text based searches in SQL agent.
    (The model did not improved though)
    # Improve the SGD ML model (Add the [SEP] tokens to separate resume text from job description text and retrain the model.)

    # Suppose from the database if user wants to retreive candidate for other roles then it should support that as well
    (During job description upload if JD has requirement of data scientist but if our database has android developers then next time
    if HR asks to shortlist based on that then our bot should do it .)
    
    # Migrated and added the user data in RAG along with SQL for retrieval
        - Add metadata to stored documents like thread id , name , email and other candidate details
        - Add filters in similarity search (for now we only have filter using thread_id )
        - Add a query rewriter / rephraser that understand the chat history and rewrites the queries of user for RAG retrieval of database
